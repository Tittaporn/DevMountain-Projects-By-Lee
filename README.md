# DevMountain-Projects-By-Lee
These repository included my learning projects from @iOS App Development Bootcamp at Dev Mountain.

## Solar System
Students will work with tableviews, learn about computed properties, and implement the UITableViewDataSource and UITableViewDelegate protocol methods to build a Solar System directory.

#### Students who complete this project independently are able to:

* Instantiate a UItableViewControler
* Work with UITableVIewControllers
* Implement a master-detail interface
* Instantiate and place UIImages on the screen
* Use a Model Object Controller to access Model Objects

## DaysOfWeekByLee
It was the second app we built at DevMountain. It was simple app to display day of the week using xCode and UIViewController to build it.

## BookShelf
Bookshelf application. was the first assessment app at DevMountain. The bookshelf should hold 6 books of your choosing.

* The initial screen shows a list of books. Each row shows the book title and the author's name.
* Tapping on a row will take you to the books detail page.
* The detail view should present the books details including: title, author, cover, release year, and description.
* The detail view should include a back button that, when pressed, takes you back to the initial screen.
* Have some fun with this app. If time permits, use some cool fonts and background colors to help make your app pop.

#### Black Diamonds
* Use the Date type for the release date and present the full date to the user (month, day, year). 
* Covered Concepts
* This assessment is intended to assess your ability to build applications that make use of simple UIViews & UITableViews to display a collection of data, and are built using Storyboards, segues, and IBOutlets. It covers the following concepts taught in Week 1:

#### Basic data Types
* The role and use of UIViewController
* The role and use of UITableViewController
* The role and use of UINavigationController
* Use of IBOutlet

 ### @iOS App Development Bootcamp at Dev Mountain
Over 13 demanding weeks in our iOS development bootcamp you’ll find out what it means to be an app developer. Using tools like Github and Xcode to collaborate, and languages like Objective-C and Swift to create, you’ll prepare for a career in tech. At the end of the course, students work with Software QA and UX Design students to create an app for Apple products.
